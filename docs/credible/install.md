## App stores

We are also in the process of listing Credible on the iOS TestFlight and Android
Play Beta programs, and eventually their respective app marketplaces plus
F-Droid.

## Common Dependencies

To manually build Credible for either Android or iOS, you will need to install
the following dependencies (instructions follow):

- Rust
- Java 7 or higher
- Flutter (`dev` channel)
- [DIDKit](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit)/[SSI](https://github.com/spruceid/ssi)
- `wasm-pack` (WEB)
- `binaryen` (WEB and targeting ASM.js)

### Rust

It is recommended to use [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to
manage your Rust installation.

### Java

On Ubuntu you could run:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```

For more information, please refer to the documentation of your favorite flavour
of Java and your operating system/package manager.

### Flutter

Please follow the official instalation instructions available 
[here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter,
don't forget to also install the build dependencies for the platform you
will be building (Android SDK/NDK, Xcode, etc).

We currently only support build this project using the `dev` channel of Flutter.

To change your installation to the `dev` channel, please execute the following command:

```bash
$ flutter channel dev
$ flutter upgrade
```

To confirm that everything is setup correctly, please run the following command
and resolve any issues that arise before proceeding to the next steps.

```bash
$ flutter doctor
```

### `wasm-pack` (Required for both WEB targets)

The wasm-pack cannot yet be compiled from crates.io. For now, to build the WASM
target you will need `wasm-pack`, the fastest way is to fetch the script from
github and run it in the credible root directory:

```bash
$ curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
```


### `binaryen`

To build Credible for WEB using ASM.js you will need
[binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), which allows the conversion
of DIDKit WASM to ASM.js. This is necessary in context where WASM support is not
available and DIDKit needs to run in pure Javascript. More detailed instructions
on how to build `binaryen` can be found
[here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen).

If you are in a UNIX-like distribution you just have to clone the repo and build,
we recommend cloning into your `${HOME}`, to avoid having to specify the
`${BINARYEN_ROOT}` variable:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen ~/binaryen
$ cd ~/binaryen
$ cmake . && make
```

Not that binaryen support for OS X and Windows is still limited, so it is highly
recommended to build it in a linux shell on OS X and on WSL2 in Windows. For
instructions on building it natively in Windows, see [the binaryen
FAQ](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen#faq) on github.

### DIDKit and SSI

This project also depends on two other Spruce projects,
[`DIDKit`](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit) and
[`SSI`](https://github.com/spruceid/ssi). 

These projects are all configured to work with relative paths by default, so it
is recommended to clone them all as subdirectories of the same root directory,
for example 
``
$HOME/spruceid/didkit
$HOME/spruceid/ssi
$HOME/spruceid/credible
$HOME/spruceid/treehouse
etc
``

## Target-Specific Dependencies

### Android Dependencies

To build Credible for Android, you will require both the Android SDK and NDK.

These two dependencies can be easily obtained with [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install), which install further
dependencies upon first being opened after installation. Installing the
appropriate Android NDK (often not the newest) in Android Studio can be
accomplished by going to Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings >
Android SDK and selecting to install the "NDK (Side by Side)". An alternative
method of installing SDK and NDK without Android Studio can be found in the
optional
[install_android_dependencies.sh](https://github.com/spruceid/credible/blob/main/install_android_dependencies.sh)
script included here.

If your Android SDK doesn't live at `$HOME/Android/Sdk` you will need to set
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` like so:

```bash
$ export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/Android/Sdk
```

*Note: Some users have experienced difficulties with expected cross-compilation
artefacts missing from the newest NDK, which is downloaded by default in the
installation process.  If you experience errors of this kind, you may have to
manually downgrade or install multiple NDK versions as [shown
here])(img/ndk_downgrade.png) in the Android Studio installer (screengrabbed
from an Ubuntu installation). Alternately, running all or parts of the
[install_android_dependencies.sh](install_android_dependencies.sh) script may be
helpful.*

If your `build-tools` and/or `NDK`  live in different locations than the default ones inside /SDK/, or if you want to specify a specific NDK or build-tools version, you can manually configure the following two environment variables:

```bash
$ export ANDROID_TOOLS=/path/to/SDK/build-tools/XX.X.X/
$ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/SDK/ndk/XX.X.XXXXX/
```
::: 

### iOS Dependencies

To build Credible for iOS you will need to install CocoaPods, which can be done
with Homebrew on MacOS, WSL2, or Linux-based systems. You will also need
[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which is not available for WSL2 or
Linux systems; it is currently possible but not recommended to install XCode
in those build environments.

```bash
$ sudo apt install linuxbrew-wrapper
$ brew install cocoapods
```

### Web Dependencies

To build Credible for WASM, you will need the Node.JS and its package manager,
`npm` to be installed:

```bash
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm
```

*Note: in some environments, such as Ubuntu 18.04, npm may not automatically
install a new enough version for our makefile to execute succesfully; overriding
it with `npm`'s [internal
commands](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/681#issuecomment-793916156) may be
necessary.*

## Building DIDKit for different targets

### Android

To build `DIDKit` for the Android targets, you will go to the root of `DIDKit`
and run:

```bash
$ make -C lib install-rustup-android
$ make -C lib ../target/test/java.stamp
$ make -C lib ../target/test/aar.stamp
$ make -C lib ../target/test/flutter.stamp
$ cargo build
```
*This may take some time as it compiles the entire project for multiple targets*

### Android APK
```bash
$ flutter build apk --no-sound-null-safety
```

### Android App Bundle
```bash
$ flutter build appbundle --no-sound-null-safety
```

### iOS

To build DIDKit for the iOS targets, you wGo to the root of `DIDKit` and run
: 

```bash
$ make -C lib install-rustup-ios 
$ make -C lib ../target/test/ios.stamp
$ cargo build
```

### Web *using WASM*

```bash
$ make -C lib ../target/test/wasm.stamp
```

### Web *using ASM.js*

If you have installed `bynarien` somewhere other than $HOME, you will have to
set `BYNARIEN_ROOT` as shown below, otherwise, just run the `make` command.

```bash
$ export BINARYEN_ROOT=/path/to/binaryen
$ make -C lib ../target/test/asmjs.stamp
```

## Building Credible

You are now ready to build or run Credible.

### Run on emulator

If you want to run the project on your connected device, you can use:

```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

### Run on browser

If you want to run the project on your browser, you can use:

```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety -d chrome --csp --release
```

Otherwise, Flutter allows us to build many artifacts for Android, iOS and WEB,
below you can find the most common and useful commands, all of which you should
run from the root of Credible.

### iOS .app for Simulator
```bash
$ flutter build ios --no-sound-null-safety --no-codesign --simulator
```

### iOS .app for Devices
```bash
$ flutter build ios --no-sound-null-safety --no-codesign
```

### iOS IPA
```bash
$ flutter build ipa --no-sound-null-safety
```

### Web
```bash
$ flutter build web \
  --no-sound-null-safety \
  --csp \
  --release
```

If you don't have support for WASM, you'll probably need to provide your own
`canvaskit` dependency without WASM as well as DIDKit, to do that you need to
specify the `FLUTTER_WEB_CANVASKIT_URL` in the build command like below.

```bash
$ flutter build web \
  --no-sound-null-safety \
  --csp \
  --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_CANVASKIT_URL=vendor/ \
  --release
```

For more details about any of these commands you can run
```bash
$ flutter build $SUBCOMMAND --help
```

### Note about `nullsafety`


While we are ready to migrate to Dart with nullsafety, a couple of the
dependencies of the project are still lagging behind, so we need to add `--no-sound-null-safely` to both run and build commands for the time being.

### Note about `canvaskit`

Since by default `canvaskit` comes in a `WASM` build, in order to the `ASM.js`
be fully supported `canvaskit` was manually built for this target.

A prebuilt `canvaskit` is already included in the Credible web folder.
If you want to build it by yourself, however, follow these steps:

- Install [`emscripten`](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
- Clone [Skia](https://skia.org/user/download) repository and pull its dependencies

```bash
git clone https://skia.googlesource.com/skia.git --depth 1 --branch canvaskit/0.22.0
cd skia
python2 tools/git-sync-deps
```

- Modify build script `modules/canvaskit/compile.sh`

```
diff --git a/modules/canvaskit/compile.sh b/modules/canvaskit/compile.sh
index 6ba58bfae9..51f0297eb6 100755

- Build `canvaskit`

```bash
$ cd modules/canvaskit
$ make debug
```

- Replace this line on `$SKIA/modules/canvaskit/canvaskit/bin/canvaskit.js`

```git
618c618
< var isNode = !(new Function('try {return this===window;}catch(e){ return false;}')());
---

```

- Copy `$SKIA/modules/canvaskit/canvaskit/bin/canvaskit.js` to
`$CREDIBLE/web/vendor/`

- Build Credible as described above.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Environment Problems

If you encounter any errors in the build process described here, please first try
clean builds of the projects listed.

For instance, on Flutter, you can delete build files to start over by running:

```bash
$ flutter clean
```
Also, reviewing the
[install_android_dependencies.sh](install_android_dependencies.sh) script line
by line or even rerunning it line by line may be helpful.

### Opaque Makefile error messages

* NPM may through an opaque error when compiling to WASM or ASM.js if `apt
  install` has installed too old of a version of `npm` based on your operating
  system kernel. This can be manually overridden from `npm`'s [internal
  commands](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/681#issuecomment-793916156)
