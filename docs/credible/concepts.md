Credible is designed to be a powerful but simple personal wallet for holding
verifiable credentials-- and little more. 

## High-level explanation of QR Code Logic

All QRCode interactions start as listed below:
1. User scans a QRCode containing a URL;
2. User is presented the choice to trust the domain in the URL;
3. App makes a GET request to the URL;

Then, depending on the type of message, one of the following protocols will be
executed.

If this all sounds a little esoteric, watch the [example video](example--qr-issuance.md) first. 

## CredentialOffer

If the wallet manages multiple keypairs/subject identifiers, the user will be
prompted to select one. If no additional subject identifiers are available, the
wallet will default to the on-device keypair created at time of installation. If
this cannot be found, the protocol will throw an exception.

After receiving a `CredentialOffer` from a trusted host and selecting (or
defaulting to) an identifier to which that credential will be issued, the wallet
app calls the issuer's API with the selected `subject_id` in the form body. If
the on-device identifier is chosen or defaulted to, it must first be wrapped in
a "DID:Key" object (See glossary), which is derived deterministically from the
keypair stored in the `FlutterSecureStorage`, which is backed by [KeyStore][] on
Android and [Keychain][] on iOS.

### Offer Flow

**Note: some features in this flow are current unstable and may not work as documented.**

The flow of events and actions is thus:
1. User is presented a credential preview to review and make their decision
   whether or not receive it (coming soon: option to select subject DID if
   wallet holds multiple)
2. App makes a POST request to the initial URL with `subject_id` set to this
   DID;
3. App receives and stores the new credential in app storage;
4. User is redirect back to the wallet's homepage.

## Verifiable Presentation Request

After receiving a `VerifiablePresentationRequest` from a trusted host, the
wallet app calls the requestor's POST API with the `presentation` value set in
the body. This value is a stringified JSON-LD presentation object generated
from the selected credential and signed with the credential's private key using
`DIDKit.issuePresentation`.

### Parameters

Here are some of the parameters used to generate a presentation:
- `presentation`
  - `id` is set to a unique and random `UUID.v4` generated in each `issuePresentation` call;
  - `holder` is set to the selected credential's subject (DID);
  - `verifiableCredential` contains the presented credential in stringified JSON-LD form;
- `options`
  - `verificationMethod` is set to the `id` field in the passed DID's `verificationMethod`;
  - `proofPurpose` only supports 'authentication' for now;
  - `challenge` is set to the `challenge` value found in the request;
  - `domain` is set to the `domain` value found in the request;
- `key` is the credential's stored private key;


### VP Request Flow

The flow of events and actions is listed below:
- User is presented a presentation request to review and make a decision;
- App generates `didKey` from the stored private key using `DIDKit.keyToDIDKey`;
- App issues a presentation using `DIDKit.issuePresentation`;
- App makes a POST request to the initial URL with the presentation;
- User is redirect back to the wallet.

## Future Protocols

Coming in future versions (before v1.0)
* DIDComm v2 support
* Presentation Exchange

Note: Verifiable Presentation requests are presented in the form specified by the current W3C-CCG [VP Request Spec] draft. As community-wide, vendor-agnostic specifications for Credential/[Presentation Exchange][], [Wallet Portability][], and DID-based [Transport][] come into maturity, we will support them in future versions.
