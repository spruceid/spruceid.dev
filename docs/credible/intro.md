Credible is a lightweight wallet for individuals to manage DIDs and VCs from
their mobile phones. It is white-label friendly, open-source, and build on our
core SSI libraries.  As soon as it is feature-complete and ready for external
review, it will even be downloadable from the appstore in its basic, unextended
form. Over time, we expect to integrate many DID methods and presentation
protocols to make this the wallet fully-featured without being ledger-bound or
vendor-favoring.

## Features

* QR support to initiate and execute issuance and presentation of verifiable
  credentials
* Handy interface for generating multiple DIDs (and coming soon, multiple DIDs
  across multiple ledgers)
* Official decentralized-identity wallet of DID Method Tezos (DID:tz)
* Built in Flutter, for leaner, faster builds and less dependencies

## Coming soon

The following features have been tentatively roadmapped for the next major release:
1. Better support (and code snippets) for passing OIDC tokens back to service
   authenticated with Credible
