DID Kit makes as accessible, simple, and portable as possible 
the core engine of any credentialing system built around W3C
 verifiable credentials: the issuance and verification mechanisms.

## High-level explanation of core logic

The generation of VCs and VPs requires three separate inputs:
1. **Key Material**: of the *issuer* in the case of a VC, or of
 the *holder* in the case of a VP
2. **Data Payload**: typically JSON in the case of VCs, and an
array of 1 or more VCs in the case of VPs
3. **Data Structure**: in the form of JSON-LD Schema

From these, a 4th element, the "proof" is generated by signing
 over 2 and 3 with 1.  Once these four elements have been 
 combined, a verifiable credential is a portable, tamper-evident 
 unit of data. Optionally, the data often contains the identifier
  of a "data subject" of the credential; this identifier is often
   the vital link between a VP and its contents, rendering the 
   whole package meaningful and verifiable.

Running the process in reverse from the side of a verifier, we 
start from the whole tamperproofed package. Verifying the proofs
 on a VC or VP requires fetching key material and verification 
 method (i.e., the *type* of key material) from the listed issuer
  or holder (respectively). It is important to note that the data
   "payload" of a VP is usually one or more VCs and nothing else,
    so verifying the outer layer (the VP) reveals a new proof and
     identity to be queried for key and key type (the VC).

## Semantics 

The third element in the above explanation can be the hardest for
 developers new to the world of decentralized identity and 
 credentialing to grapple with. This is because the data structure
  mechanisms assumed and expressed in the examples of the core
   W3C specifications are so-called "open-world," semantic-web
    semantics expressed in JSON-LD, rather than the closed-world,
     static JSON schema that most developers use day in and day
      out. While static JSON schema are easier to use and easier
       to secure in conventional ways, the more dynamic and 
       open-data-friendly mechanics of JSON-LD are given pride of
        place in the decentralized identity community.  

:::note 
DIDKit was built for LD data structures, and currently requires 
VC semantics to be expressed in JSON-LD, but support for static 
structures in "vanilla" JSON VC/VP representations (aka "JWT"s)
 is forthcoming.

## Verification Methods

DID Documents are signed and verifiable data objects containing key material,
metadata, and routing/addressing information to support cross-context
identification and verification. As such, they can be queried or qualifed by
"verificationMethod", i.e. by purpose, in case they contain multiple keys (or
multiple representations of the same key) for different purposes. In a typical
`did:key` document like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:key:z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:key:z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW#z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW", 
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "did:key:z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW",
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "kty": "OKP",
        "crv": "Ed25519",
        "x": "-kMHp5nohaFOK5E9Jch4ErdgwMFYFUc4Lt_wYlAGy8s"
      }
    }
  ],
  "authentication": [
    "did:key:z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW#z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW"
  ],
  "assertionMethod": [
    "did:key:z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW#z6MkwJBFYK8vTVGeiMsLzcqbSRXW4aTg4PozGbekWtQNUnnW"
  ]
}
```

The verification methods `#authentication` and `#assertionMethod`, two of the
most commonly used methods (for authentication and for signing verifiable
credentials or other assertion formats) are simply aliases for the main key,
which is simply the entire DID itself (without the prefix `did:key`) after the
`#` symbol.
