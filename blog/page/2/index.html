class="markdown"><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*t-I_SWlXpOJUOTpqzZ8jew.png" alt="spruce and tezos logos dancing slowly"></p><p>Today, we are proud to announce our collaboration with the Tezos ecosystem, with which we have begun working to add decentralized identity capabilities built using the latest W3C standards. Our first efforts will result in extensible open-source identity products built on Tezos, including tools for the issuance, storage, verification, and governance of trusted information to allow any Tezos account to demonstrate who (or what) they are on their own terms, without sacrificing privacy.</p><p>We are thrilled to be working with the team at TQ Tezos in order to bring digital identity to life, and are looking forward to working with ecosystem projects such as Tezos Domains, Taquito, Beacon, Kukai, and Agora in order to augment their initiatives with Tezos-based decentralized identities.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="digital-identity-and-blockchain-based-smart-contracts"></a>Digital identity and blockchain-based smart contracts<a class="hash-link" href="#digital-identity-and-blockchain-based-smart-contracts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*HDhm6a5ygumwIwOc" alt="use case diagram"></p><p><em>Examples of opportunities to refactor trusted workflows</em></p><p>To drive impact outside of on-chain transactions and smart contracts, blockchains must construct read and write pointers to the real-world as secure digital representations. Anything from asset issuance, to business contract verification, to trusted oracles require some form of digital identity, which is the way we recognize, remember, and respond to other actors. We’ve seen projects spend valuable engineering hours re-constructing the same digital identity components in order to satisfy their trust and compliance needs.</p><p>Spruce is building common identity infrastructure that offers standard and interoperable ways to manage things like documents, authorizations, and integrations with third-party verifiers. These processes are then used to establish credentials for people and things (e.g., account ownership, investor sophistication assessments, authoritative copies, data feeds, etc.) held by account controllers and presented at will without requiring intermediaries.
These are critical building blocks to enable use cases such as compliance for digital assets, transparent government, and scalable data storage without loss of integrity. This way, applications can focus more on their core business logic instead of reinventing identity components.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="why-tezos"></a>Why Tezos<a class="hash-link" href="#why-tezos" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We believe the Tezos ecosystem is a strong fit for Spruce’s efforts considering its vision, community practices, and focus on high assurance. Additionally, the decentralized identity ecosystem has much to gain from the Tezos ecosystem’s reciprocal involvement. By focusing our efforts within a single ecosystem from the outset, we are able to ensure production readiness across a complete integrated stack so that solutions will function flawlessly from the end-user interfaces down to the blockchain protocol level.</p><p>Tezos’ focus on governance and upgradable protocols aligns with the notion of trust frameworks in mapping human-made rules into machine-readable protocols. As an example, there are several common activities in the baking ecosystem, such as staking rewards auditing, which are excellent candidates for formalizing into verifiable credentials-based interactions.</p><p>We also look forward to interacting with Tezos’ rich ecosystem of formal verification engineers to prove properties of our software, such as that it is impossible to issue a credential in an invalid state. We also anticipate collaborations using zero-knowledge protocols to advance the state of the art in the decentralized identity ecosystem, which has already pioneered selective credential disclosure using BBS+ signatures in conjunction with BLS12–381 (the Zcash pairing-friendly elliptic curve). There is immense opportunity for mutual gain at both the ecosystem and technology layers.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="our-vision"></a>Our vision<a class="hash-link" href="#our-vision" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our long-term vision is to enable every Tezos wallet with identity capabilities and to allow any project to issue credentials for end-users to utilize throughout their various journeys. With these components, Tezos products will have standard capabilities to tie into reality: Tezos accounts can be selectively augmented with real-world credentials while preserving privacy, asset structuring time can be reduced from months to days, and transactions can generate credentials spawning off-chain interactions.</p><p>Historically, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) have relied on public blockchains to produce DID methods that are censorship-resistant, free of gatekeepers, and globally unique and consistent. However, we believe that decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials (VCs) are key to unlocking the true economic value of smart contracts by bridging on-chain accounts to real-world entities, assets, relationships, and regulators. They allow transactions to break out of the blockchain sandbox and directly impact or become impacted by real-world systems while remaining peer-to-peer.</p><p>For example, the EU-based eIDAS Observatory is discussing the use of blockchain-based DIDs within the eIDAS trust framework to take legally binding and non-repudiable actions tied to registered entities. The Verifiable Organizations Network has been adopted at the Government of British Columbia in Canada as the OrgBook to provide authentic and authoritative DID-based business identifiers and credentials. The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, established by recommendations from the G20 to prevent another financial crisis, is using verifiable credentials to establish trust and authenticity for business entities globally.</p><p>We believe that building the standard way to interact with verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers on Tezos will allow its smart contract ecosystem to fully leverage all such network effects regardless from which blockchain or network DIDs and VCs originate. This would supercharge smart contracts by building a reliable clutch to off-chain actors, assets, and legal frameworks.</p><p>Additionally, this allows identity to become a gateway to the Tezos ecosystem. A new user can be introduced and integrated into the Tezos ecosystem simply by receiving credentials and wanting to use a credential-enabled service. A DID Method alone does not necessarily add value to a network — there needs to be usage.</p><p>We look forward to continued engagement with the Tezos ecosystem as we work to make decentralized identity on Tezos a reality.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contact-us"></a>Contact us<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to</em> <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>leave us a message</em></a><em>, and we will respond within 24 hours.</em> </p><p>Or just Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/spruce">spruce</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tezos">tezos</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/identity">identity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_3-lP"><a href="/blog/introducing-spruce">Introducing Spruce</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-08-25T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_Ta7i">August 25, 2020  · 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/wyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/858687?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Wayne Change"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/wyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Change</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Bodega Afficionado and CEO</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>![brand asset][(https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*sMqXocIDsrw2SiKn.png](<a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ILg9HYN8JxQOSuk8ftFpkA.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ILg9HYN8JxQOSuk8ftFpkA.png</a>))</p><p><em>Spruce is reimagining trusted interactions for enterprises and governments — the stewards of the most foundational and impactful layers of infrastructure shaping our lives.</em></p><p>When’s the last time you felt comfortable sending or receiving important documents digitally? Have you ever been shocked at how much an online platform knows about you and wish you had more control over your identity? As a business, do your customers feel any of the above when they’re doing business with you?</p><p>For all the mountains of data and technology surging through every aspect of our lives — business transactions, government services, staying connected with people, and getting our news — there lacks the trust, belief, and authenticity that we need to feel safe. In the long run, this is not good for businesses, which rely on trust relationships with their customers and partners to transact. It’s not good for democratic governments and their citizens, which rely on public transparency and verifiable information for accountability. It’s also not good for the freedom of individuals, who feel their privacy and control eroding day by day by the actions of data-hungry corporations and overreaching government programs.</p><p>To do its part to redress this issue, <strong>*Spruce is reimagining trusted interactions for enterprises and governments — the stewards of the most foundational and impactful layers of infrastructure shaping our lives**</strong>.* We believe that in any organization you can find people who wish public and private institutions respected an individual’s control over their own information and privacy. We are also pragmatists, who understand that these principles are most likely to be implemented at scale when they also make commercial and operational sense. We firmly believe that there are paths striking a balance that both respects individual liberty and allows for enterprise success.</p><p>We are creating open-source software products that help our customers go from untrusted data to verifiable information that can be shared privately and with consent. Our products enable complete lifecycle management for licenses, certificates, audit reports, registrations, and other mission-critical data that must remain secure while passing many hands. Our main workflows allow end-users to manage their own data, and for everyone else to have confidence in the consent and purpose of data shared by them. To achieve this, we will utilize a cadre of emerging data technologies, including the recent W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized Identifiers specifications, which have been designed to solve business problems while leaving ample room to champion the end user’s control within a data supply chain.</p><p>To best serve our customers, we will meet them where they are today by understanding how they must serve their own customers and internal stakeholders. We will, therefore, focus heavily on creating first-class support to link with existing identity and data appliances commonly found in enterprise environments, including identity servers, internal resource APIs, key management systems, ERPs, and cloud services. As an example, we know that for some organizations, critical infrastructure cannot be directly migrated to new publicly-downloadable mobile applications, and their existing X.509 and SAML-based workflows are extremely relevant and not going anywhere. Any new additions should acknowledge the prior work and build upon it where possible to prevent confusion. We favor approaches that tie in rather than replace, and incrementally demonstrate stability and value prior to increasing the deployment surface area.</p><p>With each new deployment of our products, we contribute to the increased adoption of privacy-enhanced protocols and practices that lay the groundwork for a more resilient future infrastructure through solid business cases. We will drive impact that increases decentralization and user control at the level that matters most, while making our customers profits and delighting their risk managers.</p><p>If you are interested in working together or hearing more about our approach, <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please reach out</a>.
